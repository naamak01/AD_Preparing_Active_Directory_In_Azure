# Preparing Active Directory Infrastructure in Azure
 
## Description
In this project I create two VMs (Virtual Machines), one running Windows Server, to act as a Domain Controller. The other VM will act as a client, running Windows 10 that will join the domain. In later projects, I will deploy AD, run a script that will create users in the domain, which I can log into from the client VM, then manage the accounts and update the group policies, all to simulate a real-life IT environment!

## Environments and Utilities Used
* Microsoft Azure
* Virtual Machines
* Remote Desktop Connection
